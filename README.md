# Github
Here is the link to my Github repository: https://github.com/samantha-jerry/CS332-Lab1 

Please note that I don't believe I am currently in the CS332 Github classroom (I cannot access it from https://classroom.github.com using my UAB github account). 
I was able to access the assignment intro-to-git-and-github-samantha-jerry but I could not find a dedicated Lab 1 space to upload my code.
